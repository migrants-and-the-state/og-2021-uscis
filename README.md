aperitiiif batch of nara a files for migrants and the state neh grant project ðŸ¥‚

## description

this is a modified aperitiiif batch repo. because of the size, images are not stored cannonically in the repo and processed by the github `publish-batch` action. 

instead, cannonical pdfs and images are stored in an NYU Research Workspace (RW) volume. the rake tasks in `lib` process the files from the volume mounted locally and sync the generated image and json resources for the IIIF APIs directly to AWS S3 using credentials stored (and gitignored) in `.env`.

the github action is used to deploy the results to github pages only.
